# **Funko pop Gallery**

## Project Description

This project was designed with HTML5 and CSS3 to mainly practice **flexbox**.
Despite being a simple one-page site, it is fully responsive for all types of devices. This was achieved with the practice of media queries.

The project is simple and does not have a functionality other than the practice of flexbox. The design does not include a *navbar* but it does include a *footer* to be able to see how the images are adapted and the *footer* itself applying media queries. The images are funko pops that have a design adapted for the practice of flexbox.
